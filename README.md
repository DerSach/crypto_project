Create your own portfolio of crypto and see your current profit

**Prerequisite**

pip install pandas

pip install requests

Get a free CoinAPI Key: https://www.coinapi.io/

**Usage**

Execute from terminal this way:

python crypto_project.py CoinAPIKey

You will then have the possibility to either type "add" or "profit" if you want to (i) "add" crypto to your portfolio, or (ii) get your current "profit" (in EUR)

When (i) adding a currency to your portfolio, you need to fill in:
- the date (dd/mm/yy) of trade
- the crypto symbol you bought (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies)
- the price in EUR at which you bought a unit of the crypto
- the amount in EUR of your trade

(ii) does not need anything more than typing "profit", the profit will be displayed in EUR directly in your terminal

Hope it helps :) !
